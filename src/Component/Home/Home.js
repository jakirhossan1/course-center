                        Our citizens can take health suggestions for free now
                        from doctors working in government health centers. For
                        this a mobile phone has been given to each district and
                        sub-district hospital of Bangladesh. The numbers of these
                        mobile phones have been publicized locally.

                    <p>
                        These numbers are also given in the website of Directorate
                        General of Health Services (www.dghs.gov.bd). Doctors receive
                        calls in these numbers 24 hours. Local people can receive free health suggestions
                        by calling these numbers without need for coming to hospitals in person.

                    <p>This service has created opportunity to get medical advice by rich or poor people living
                        particularly in rural areas. Medical advice now may be instantly available no matter whether
                        it is late night, an acute health problem or long distance from hospital. For conditions where
                        patients do not need to come to hospital, </p>

                    <p>Many people come to out-patient departments of the government hospitals.
                        It often becomes difficult to provide service with limited
                        man-power and medicine. If health service through mobile phone gets wide publicity,
                        a lot of people will be able to take health service
                        from their residence. </p>
