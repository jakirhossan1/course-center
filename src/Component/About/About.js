                <p>A long felt need of the people of Jorhat was fulfilled with the laying
                    of the Foundation Stone of the Jorhat Medical College by Hon'ble Prime
                    Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh, in presence of Hon'ble Chief Minister
                    of Assam Sjt Tarun Gogoi, Hon’ble Union Minister of Law & Justice Shri Veerappa Moily,
                    Hon’ble Union Minister of Mines and DoNER Shri B.K. Handique, Hon’ble Health Minister
                    of Assam Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Hon’ble MLA Shri Rana Goswami and a galaxy of distinguished
                    guests and a huge crowd, on the historic day of 25th August 2008. The Mission took a giant step
                    when the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Assam Sjt Tarun Gogoi inaugurated the hospital wing of the
                    Jorhat Medical College on 12th October 2009. The coming up of the 500+ bedded Jorhat Medical College
                    Hospital equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic, therapeutic ICU/ICCU and patient care facilities
                    including a modern integrated residential campus has brought about a sea change in the health care
                    scenario in the entire district of Jorhat and beyond.
